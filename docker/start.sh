# build_labels_chain: optional feature — draws
# pointer/callout labels onto specific
# coordinates in the video, similar to
# hand-annotated documentary footage. Fully
# optional per video: only activates if a file
# named <basename>.labels.txt exists.
#
# File format — one label per line, comma
# separated:
#   x,y,Label text here
# where x,y is the pixel position on the
# 1280x720 output frame that the label should
# point at. Box placement, connector line, and
# edge-avoidance (flips below/left near frame
# edges) are computed automatically.
#
# Visual style matches the rest of the panel:
# gold-ring/white marker dot (uses the
# pre-rendered dot_marker.png), gold-tinted
# connector line, and a label box with a gold
# accent bar + thin gold outline (same language
# as the CTA box).
#
# Notes/limits:
#  - Keep label text under ~28 characters — the
#    box is a fixed width and does not
#    reflow/resize to fit longer text.
#  - Best used for points with x > ~370 so
#    labels don't collide with the left info
#    panel.
#  - The connector is a right-angle line
#    (vertical then horizontal), not a true
#    diagonal — ffmpeg has no native diagonal
#    line primitive without much heavier
#    filters, so this is the practical choice.
#  - Requires dot_marker.png (generated once at
#    startup) to be wired in as ffmpeg input
#    index 2 — see run_video()'s -i list.
#
# Sets globals: LABELS_CHAIN (filter string to
# append), LABELS_OUT (bracketed output label
# to continue the chain from, e.g. "[base]" if
# no labels file exists, or the last label's
